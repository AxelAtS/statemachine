= StateMachine Changelog

== Version 0.0.3

Bug fix dealing with entry and exit actions.  The state machine's state need to be set to the entered/exited state before calling the 
exit/entry action.
* added a couple specs in the exit_entry_spec
* modified state.entered/exited methods to set the state
* modifed the StateMachine.state to accept state objects.
* removed running attribute from StateMachine because it wasn't much use
* also removed the nil (end state)

== Version 0.0.2

More conventional file structure
* nothing much to report in terms of changes.

0.0.0 didn't seem to work as a gem so maybe this one will.

* states
* transitions
